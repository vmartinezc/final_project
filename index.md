## General Overview

### Background


Mike Benson, the leader of the Conquerors International Strength Team, has been a missionary for the past fifteen years of his life. He has travelled the world sharing the good news of the Gospel. 
He wants to grow his ministry, but one of the only things he lacks is a proper website for his ministry. 
For that reason, we would like to work on a project that will provide Mike with a website that will allow him to further his ministry. Mike’s current website: http://www.theconquerors.net/ is out of date and he is unable to change any of its content.

### Research Question
How to best develop a progressive web app for an Evangelical Missionary?

---

### Solution

Our solution is to develop a responsive web application that will host all of Mike's ministry updates, an event calendar, newsletters, online store, and donations page. The website is HTTPS secures and mobile friendly.
Moreover, one of our main goals was to add a content management system, UmbracoCMS, that will make the process of editing the website as easy as possible for Mike. We developed the the heavy lifting of laying the content out on the website and providing Mike with very simple textboxes, macro and partial views. He will be able to drag and drop the content on the page.
