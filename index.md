Mike Benson, the leader of the Conquerors International Strength Team, has been a missionary for the past fifteen years of his life. He has travelled the world sharing the good news of the Gospel. 
He wants to grow his ministry, but one of the only things he lacks is a proper website for his ministry. 
For that reason, we would like to work on a project that will provide Mike with a website that will allow him to further his ministry. Mikeâ€™s current website: http://www.theconquerors.net/ is out of date and he is unable to change any of its content.
